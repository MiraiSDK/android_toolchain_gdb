	Back port a patch from gdb-6.8. Without this patch, arm-eabi-gdb
	crashes if the .debug_line section contains an empty file name
	table. See the following page for details.

		* dwarf2read.c (dwarf2_debug_line_missing_file_complaint): New
		function.
		(dwarf_decode_lines): Check for line info without a file.

	Change bfd/doc/Makefile.in so that the generated bfd.info is the
	object directory.  This fixes a build problem where p4 checks out
	a copy of bfd.info in the source tree as read-only.
